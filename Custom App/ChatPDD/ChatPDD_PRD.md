# ChatPDD Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Simplify the complex process of selecting appropriate carbon methodologies and standards for project developers and investors.
- Provide guidance on certification processes, documentation requirements, and climate risk assessment.
- Offer profile-based methodology recommendations and geographic-specific risk assessment.
- Assist users in navigating baseline-and-credit methodologies and certification schemes.

### Background Context

The Carbon Mitigation Project Feasibility Study Assistant (ChatPDD) is a web application designed to help project developers and investors conduct feasibility studies for carbon mitigation projects. It integrates data from various sources, including climate transitional risks (policy and regulatory), climate physical risks, and a comprehensive collection of carbon standards and methodologies. The application aims to provide an intuitive user experience and is built on a modern, scalable technology stack using Next.js and Cloudflare's infrastructure.
