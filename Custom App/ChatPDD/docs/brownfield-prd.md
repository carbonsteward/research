### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

- Implement comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment
- Establish proper environment management with staging and production configurations
- Resolve current deployment issues and git repository setup problems
- Enable automated database migration deployment and rollback procedures
- Create monitoring, security scanning, and performance optimization pipelines
- Modernize development workflow without disrupting existing application functionality

#### Background Context

The ChatPDD application represents a sophisticated climate technology platform with strong technical foundations but critical infrastructure gaps. Currently, all files are untracked in git, Vercel deployment is failing, and there are no GitHub Actions workflows despite having comprehensive CI_CD_WORKFLOW.md documentation. The application has excellent testing infrastructure (Jest + Playwright) and build tools, but lacks the automation to leverage them effectively.

This enhancement addresses the gap between a well-architected application and modern DevOps practices, enabling the development team to scale effectively while maintaining code quality and deployment reliability. The focus is on infrastructure modernization rather than feature development, making this a brownfield enhancement that preserves existing functionality while dramatically improving development and deployment capabilities.

### UI Consistency Requirements

- All existing shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS patterns shall remain unchanged
- Any future monitoring dashboards shall follow established design system patterns
- Error handling and loading states shall maintain current UX patterns

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript (strict mode), JavaScript (Node.js runtime)
**Frameworks**: Next.js 15.2.4, React 19, Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (comprehensive 372-line schema)
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment platform (currently failing), pnpm package manager
**External Dependencies**: Climate Policy Radar API, FAO FAOLEX API, NGFS Climate Scenarios, Climate Impact Explorer

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Prisma migration system with automated deployment through GitHub Actions, maintain current schema versioning and connection pooling approaches

**API Integration Strategy**: Preserve all existing Next.js API routes (/api/*) while adding health check enhancements and monitoring integration points

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: No changes to existing React components or UI patterns, CI/CD integration will be transparent to frontend code

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing Jest and Playwright configurations with CI-optimized settings, parallel execution, and coverage reporting while maintaining current test organization structure

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
- Add `.github/workflows/` directory for GitHub Actions workflows
- Add environment configuration files (.env.staging, .env.production)
- Enhance existing scripts/ directory with CI/CD utilities
- Preserve all existing directory structures and naming patterns

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing kebab-case for workflow files, maintain current TypeScript naming conventions for all application code

**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing ESLint configuration and TypeScript strict mode settings, enhance with CI enforcement without changing rules

**Documentation Standards**: Follow existing documentation patterns established in CLAUDE.md and architecture documents, add CI/CD specific documentation in docs/ci-cd/

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Enhance existing Next.js build process with environment-specific optimizations, maintain pnpm as package manager, add CI-optimized build caching

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Staging: Automated deployment from develop branch to Vercel staging environment
- Production: Manual approval gate deployment from main branch to Vercel production environment
- Database migrations: Automated during deployment with rollback procedures

**Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate with existing Winston logging system, add GitHub Actions status reporting, enhance health check endpoint (/api/health) with detailed system status

**Configuration Management**: Extend existing environment variable management with GitHub Secrets integration, maintain .env.example patterns for new environment-specific variables

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Current git repository state (all files untracked) requires careful initial commit strategy
- Existing Vercel deployment failures may indicate configuration issues requiring resolution
- Build optimization re-enablement could introduce performance regressions

**Integration Risks**:
- Database migration automation could fail if schema changes conflict with production data
- CI/CD pipeline integration might conflict with existing development workflows
- Environment variable management changes could break existing local development

**Deployment Risks**:
- Initial CI/CD pipeline deployment could disrupt current manual deployment processes
- Automated health checks might be too strict and cause unnecessary rollbacks
- Parallel test execution might reveal timing-dependent test failures

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement gradual CI/CD rollout starting with basic workflows and adding complexity incrementally
- Maintain manual deployment capabilities alongside automated systems during transition period
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to catch issues early
- Create detailed rollback procedures for all automated processes
- Test all CI/CD workflows in staging environment before production deployment

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
