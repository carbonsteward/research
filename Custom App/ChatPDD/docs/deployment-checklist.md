## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Emergency) 🚨

#### Scenario 1: Application Deployment Issues

```bash
# 1. Revert to previous Vercel deployment
vercel rollback --timeout=30s

# 2. Verify rollback
curl -f https://your-production-url.vercel.app/api/health

# 3. Notify team
echo "EMERGENCY ROLLBACK: Application deployment reverted" | \
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK: ChatPDD application reverted to previous version"}' \
  $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

#### Scenario 2: Database Migration Issues

```bash
# 1. Stop application traffic (if possible)
# Set maintenance mode in Vercel dashboard

# 2. Restore from backup
pnpm tsx scripts/restore-backup.ts --backup-id=[LATEST_BACKUP_ID]

# 3. Verify restoration
pnpm db:test
pnpm tsx scripts/validate-rollback.ts

# 4. Restart application
# Remove maintenance mode
```

### Planned Rollback (Post-Deployment Issues) ⏮️

#### Application Code Rollback

```bash
# 1. Identify previous stable deployment
vercel ls --limit=10

# 2. Create rollback plan
echo "Rolling back from $(vercel --version) to [PREVIOUS_VERSION]"

# 3. Execute rollback
vercel rollback [PREVIOUS_DEPLOYMENT_URL] --timeout=60s

# 4. Verify rollback success
pnpm tsx scripts/production-tests/rollback-verification.ts
```

#### Database Rollback (Data Migrations)

```bash
# 1. Create current state backup
pnpm tsx scripts/create-backup.ts \
  --environment=production \
  --backup-id="pre_rollback_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

# 2. Restore from pre-deployment backup
pnpm tsx scripts/restore-backup.ts --backup-id=[PRE_DEPLOYMENT_BACKUP_ID]

# 3. Verify data integrity
pnpm tsx scripts/validate-data-integrity.ts --environment=production

# 4. Update application code if needed
# Revert schema changes in code to match rolled-back database
```

### Partial Rollback (Feature-Specific) 🎯

#### Disable Collaboration Features

```bash
# 1. Set feature flags to disable collaboration
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_COLLABORATION false
vercel env add ENABLE_REAL_TIME false
vercel env add ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS false

# 2. Redeploy with collaboration disabled
NODE_ENV=production pnpm build
vercel --prod

# 3. Verify critical features still work
pnpm tsx scripts/smoke-tests/core-features.ts
```
