# ChatPDD Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview

This directory contains the sharded PRD documents for the ChatPDD Brownfield Enhancement project, specifically focused on CI/CD Infrastructure Modernization.

**Epic**: CI/CD Infrastructure Modernization
**Goal**: Transform ChatPDD from a manual development and deployment process to a fully automated CI/CD workflow with comprehensive testing, security scanning, and deployment automation while preserving all existing functionality and development patterns.

## Story Structure

The PRD has been sharded into the following implementable stories:

### Epic 1: CI/CD Infrastructure Modernization

- [Story 1.1: Repository Foundation and Git Workflow Setup](./story-1-1-repository-foundation-and-git-workflow-setup.md)
- [Story 1.2: Basic CI Pipeline Implementation](./story-1-2-basic-ci-pipeline-implementation.md)
- [Story 1.3: Comprehensive Test Automation](./story-1-3-comprehensive-test-automation.md)
- [Story 1.4: Environment Management and Configuration](./story-1-4-environment-management-and-configuration.md)
- [Story 1.5: Database Migration Automation](./story-1-5-database-migration-automation.md)
- [Story 1.6: Deployment Automation and Optimization](./story-1-6-deployment-automation-and-optimization.md)
- [Story 1.7: Security and Monitoring Integration](./story-1-7-security-and-monitoring-integration.md)

## Development Approach

**Project Type**: Brownfield Enhancement
**Integration Requirements**: Seamless integration with existing Next.js 15, React 19, PostgreSQL, and Vercel deployment architecture
**Safety Focus**: Comprehensive rollback procedures and existing functionality preservation

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
- FR1-FR8: Comprehensive CI/CD automation covering testing, deployment, database migrations, environment management, build optimization, health monitoring, and security scanning

### Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR1-NFR7: Performance, reliability, security, compatibility, and monitoring standards

### Compatibility Requirements
- CR1-CR5: Complete preservation of existing development workflow and application functionality

## Risk Management

Each story includes comprehensive rollback procedures and integration verification steps to ensure safe implementation in the existing production environment.
