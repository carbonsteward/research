# Story 1.1: Repository Foundation and Git Workflow Setup

## Story

As a **development team**,
I want **proper git repository initialization and workflow establishment**,
so that **we have a solid foundation for implementing CI/CD automation**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: All current project files are properly committed to git with meaningful initial commit message
- AC2: Git repository has proper .gitignore configuration that excludes node_modules, .env files, and build artifacts
- AC3: Main and develop branch structure is established with protection rules
- AC4: Current Vercel deployment configuration issues are identified and documented for resolution
- AC5: Git repository setup includes proper branch protection rules and merge policies
- AC6: Initial commit strategy preserves all existing functionality and configurations

## Git Repository Setup Specifics

### Repository Initialization Process

1. **Pre-commit Analysis**: Catalog all untracked files and identify critical vs. generated files
2. **Staged Commit Strategy**: Create comprehensive .gitignore before initial commit
3. **Branch Structure Setup**:
   - `main` branch: Production-ready code with strict protection rules
   - `develop` branch: Integration branch for feature development
   - Branch protection: Require PR reviews, status checks, and up-to-date branches
4. **Commit Message Standards**: Implement conventional commit format for automated changelog generation

### Critical Git Configuration

```bash
# Branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions
- Allow force pushes: false
- Allow deletions: false
```

## Integration Verification

- IV1: Verify all existing development commands (pnpm dev, pnpm build, pnpm start) continue to work after git setup
- IV2: Confirm no existing files or configurations are lost during git initialization
- IV3: Validate that development workflow remains unchanged for team members
- IV4: Verify git hooks integration doesn't interfere with existing development tools

## Rollback Procedures for Story 1.1

### Immediate Rollback (if git setup fails)

1. **Backup Restoration**: Restore complete project directory from pre-git backup
2. **File Verification**: Verify all original files and configurations are intact
3. **Development Environment Test**: Confirm `pnpm dev` and all scripts work correctly
4. **Dependency Verification**: Ensure all node_modules and build artifacts are regenerated properly

### Partial Rollback (if branch protection causes issues)

1. **Branch Protection Removal**: Temporarily disable branch protection rules
2. **Emergency Merge Process**: Implement manual code review process
3. **Gradual Re-enablement**: Re-enable protection rules one by one with testing

### Recovery Procedures

- **Lost Files Recovery**: Use `git reflog` and `git fsck` to recover any accidentally lost commits
- **Configuration Restoration**: Maintain backup of all config files (.env.example, package.json, etc.)
- **Emergency Development**: Ensure team can continue development even with git issues

## Technical Context

**Current State**: All files are untracked in git repository
**Target State**: Proper git repository with branch protection and workflow established
**Risk Level**: Medium - Foundation changes affect all subsequent CI/CD work
**Dependencies**: None (foundational story)
**Blocks**: All subsequent CI/CD stories depend on this foundation
