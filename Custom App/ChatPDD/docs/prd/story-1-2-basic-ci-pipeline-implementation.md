# Story 1.2: Basic CI Pipeline Implementation

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **automated code quality validation on every pull request**,
so that **code quality is maintained consistently across the team**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: GitHub Actions workflow executes on pull request creation and updates
- AC2: CI pipeline runs TypeScript compilation check, ESLint validation, and basic build verification
- AC3: Pipeline uses pnpm for dependency installation with caching for performance
- AC4: Failed CI checks prevent merge until issues are resolved
- AC5: CI pipeline execution completes within 5 minutes for basic checks

## Integration Verification

- IV1: Existing ESLint configuration works correctly in CI environment
- IV2: TypeScript compilation matches local development environment results
- IV3: Build process produces same artifacts as local pnpm build command
- IV4: CI pipeline failure doesn't block local development workflow
- IV5: Pipeline performance meets 5-minute target for basic checks

## Rollback Procedures for Story 1.2

### CI Pipeline Rollback

1. **Immediate Pipeline Disable**:
   - Disable GitHub Actions workflows via repository settings
   - Remove branch protection rules requiring status checks
   - Restore manual code review process
   - Document pipeline failure reasons and impact

2. **Partial Feature Rollback**:
   - Disable specific pipeline steps causing issues
   - Maintain working pipeline components
   - Implement temporary manual verification for disabled checks
   - Gradual re-enablement with monitoring

3. **Configuration Rollback**:
   - Restore original ESLint configuration if CI version differs
   - Revert TypeScript configuration changes
   - Remove CI-specific environment variables
   - Restore original build scripts and dependencies

### Emergency Development Continuity

- Team can continue development without CI pipeline
- Manual code quality checks using existing tools
- Local testing and validation procedures
- Emergency merge procedures for critical fixes

## Technical Context

**Current State**: No automated CI/CD pipeline exists
**Target State**: Basic GitHub Actions CI pipeline with code quality checks
**Risk Level**: Low - Non-destructive addition to existing workflow
**Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (Git repository foundation)
**Blocks**: Story 1.3 (Test automation requires CI foundation)

## Implementation Notes

### Required GitHub Actions Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml structure needed:
- pnpm installation and caching
- Node.js environment setup
- TypeScript compilation check
- ESLint validation
- Basic build verification
- Performance optimization (5-minute target)
```

### Integration Points

- **ESLint**: Must use existing configuration from project
- **TypeScript**: Must match local development compiler settings
- **Build Process**: Must replicate pnpm build behavior exactly
- **Caching**: Implement pnpm caching for performance
