# Story 1.5: Database Migration Automation

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **automated database migration deployment**,
so that **schema changes are consistently applied across all environments**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Prisma migrations are automatically applied during deployment process
- AC2: Migration rollback procedures are implemented and documented
- AC3: Migration deployment includes pre-deployment database backup
- AC4: Migration status verification ensures successful completion before deployment proceeds
- AC5: Migration failures trigger deployment rollback to maintain system stability
- AC6: Migration safety checks prevent destructive operations without explicit approval
- AC7: Database migration monitoring provides real-time status and failure alerts

## Database Migration Safety Procedures

### Pre-Migration Safety Checks

1. **Destructive Operation Detection**:
   - Analyze migration for DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, ALTER COLUMN operations
   - Require explicit confirmation for destructive changes
   - Implement data loss prevention safeguards
   - Generate migration impact report

2. **Database Backup Procedures**:
   ```bash
   # Automated backup before migration
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   # Backup verification
   pg_restore --list backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   # Backup integrity check
   md5sum backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

3. **Migration Validation Process**:
   - Dry-run migration in staging environment
   - Schema validation against current production structure
   - Data integrity verification post-migration
   - Performance impact assessment

### Migration Execution Strategy

1. **Staged Migration Process**:
   - Stage 1: Non-destructive additions (new tables, columns)
   - Stage 2: Data transformation and population
   - Stage 3: Destructive operations (with safety checks)
   - Stage 4: Cleanup and optimization

2. **Zero-Downtime Migration Patterns**:
   - Implement blue-green deployment for schema changes
   - Use database versioning for backward compatibility
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Connection pooling and transaction management

3. **Migration Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Real-time migration progress tracking
   - Automated alerts for migration failures
   - Performance monitoring during migration
   - Rollback trigger based on health checks

## Integration Verification

- IV1: Existing Prisma migration commands continue to work for local development
- IV2: Database schema changes are applied consistently across staging and production
- IV3: Migration automation preserves all existing data and relationships
- IV4: Migration safety checks prevent accidental data loss
- IV5: Rollback procedures restore database to previous state successfully

## Database Migration Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Migration Rollback (< 5 minutes)

1. **Automated Rollback Triggers**:
   - Health check failures after migration
   - Application startup failures
   - Critical error rate threshold exceeded
   - Manual rollback trigger via emergency procedure

2. **Fast Rollback Process**:
   ```bash
   # Stop application traffic
   # Restore from backup
   pg_restore --clean --if-exists backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   # Verify data integrity
   # Restart application
   # Verify health checks
   ```

### Extended Rollback (5+ minutes)

1. **Schema Rollback Strategy**:
   - Implement reverse migration scripts
   - Use database versioning to track changes
   - Maintain migration history for point-in-time recovery
   - Implement data reconciliation procedures

2. **Data Recovery Procedures**:
   - Point-in-time recovery from backup
   - Transaction log replay for minimal data loss
   - Data validation and integrity checks
   - User data reconciliation if needed

### Emergency Database Recovery

1. **Disaster Recovery Process**:
   - Activate disaster recovery database instance
   - Implement emergency read-only mode
   - Data synchronization procedures
   - Gradual service restoration

2. **Data Consistency Verification**:
   - Automated data validation scripts
   - Cross-reference with backup data
   - User-reported data issue tracking
   - Data reconciliation procedures

## Technical Context

**Current State**: Manual Prisma migration execution for local development
**Target State**: Automated migration deployment with comprehensive safety procedures
**Risk Level**: High - Database changes can cause data loss or application failures
**Dependencies**: Story 1.4 (Environment management for database environment separation)
**Blocks**: Story 1.6 (Deployment automation includes migration deployment)

## Implementation Notes

### Current Database Architecture

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with 372-line comprehensive schema
- **ORM**: Prisma with existing migration system
- **Current Migrations**: Located in `prisma/migrations/`
- **Schema**: `prisma/schema.prisma` with complete data model

### Migration Automation Requirements

```yaml
# Migration Pipeline Components:
- Pre-migration backup creation and verification
- Migration impact analysis and safety checks
- Staged migration execution with rollback points
- Post-migration data integrity verification
- Health check integration and monitoring
- Automated rollback triggers and procedures
```

### Critical Safety Considerations

- **Data Loss Prevention**: No destructive operations without explicit approval
- **Backup Integrity**: Automated backup verification before migration execution
- **Rollback Speed**: < 5 minute rollback capability for emergency scenarios
- **Monitoring Integration**: Real-time migration status and failure alerting
