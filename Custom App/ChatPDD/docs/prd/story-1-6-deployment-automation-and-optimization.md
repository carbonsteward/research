# Story 1.6: Deployment Automation and Optimization

## Story

As a **product team**,
I want **automated deployment to staging and production environments**,
so that **releases are consistent, reliable, and efficiently delivered**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Staging deployment is automatically triggered from develop branch merges
- AC2: Production deployment requires manual approval and is triggered from main branch
- AC3: Build optimizations (image optimization, bundle optimization) are re-enabled for production builds
- AC4: Deployment health checks verify successful deployment before completing process
- AC5: Deployment rollback procedures are implemented for failed deployments

## Integration Verification

- IV1: Production applications maintain current performance characteristics with optimizations enabled
- IV2: All existing API endpoints continue to function correctly after deployment
- IV3: Database connections and external API integrations work properly in deployed environments
- IV4: Build optimizations don't introduce runtime errors
- IV5: Deployment health checks accurately detect application status

## Rollback Procedures for Story 1.6

### Deployment Automation Rollback

1. **Immediate Manual Deployment Restore**:
   - Disable automated deployment workflows
   - Restore manual Vercel deployment procedures
   - Revert build optimization changes
   - Implement manual approval processes

2. **Build Optimization Rollback**:
   - Disable Next.js image optimization
   - Revert bundle optimization settings
   - Restore development-friendly build configuration
   - Monitor performance impact of rollback

3. **Environment Deployment Rollback**:
   - Rollback staging environment to previous version
   - Implement manual production deployment procedures
   - Restore previous deployment health check procedures
   - Document deployment issues and manual workarounds

### Emergency Deployment Procedures

- Manual deployment capability maintained as backup
- Emergency hotfix deployment without CI/CD pipeline
- Direct Vercel deployment with manual health checks
- Rollback to previous application version procedures

## Technical Context

**Current State**: Manual Vercel deployment (currently failing), build optimizations disabled
**Target State**: Automated deployment pipeline with re-enabled optimizations and health checks
**Risk Level**: High - Deployment changes affect production availability and performance
**Dependencies**: Story 1.5 (Database migration automation), Story 1.4 (Environment management)
**Blocks**: Story 1.7 (Security and monitoring integration)

## Implementation Notes

### Current Deployment Issues to Resolve

- **Vercel Deployment Failures**: Current manual deployment is failing
- **Build Optimizations Disabled**: Image optimization and bundle optimization currently disabled in `next.config.mjs`
- **Environment Configuration**: No staging vs production environment separation currently

### Deployment Pipeline Architecture

```yaml
# Staging Deployment (develop branch):
- Automated trigger on develop branch merge
- Environment: staging environment variables
- Database: staging database with migration automation
- Health checks: comprehensive application verification
- Notification: team notification of staging deployment status

# Production Deployment (main branch):
- Manual approval gate required
- Environment: production environment variables
- Database: production database with backup and migration
- Health checks: extended verification including performance
- Monitoring: enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Rollback: automated rollback on health check failure
```

### Build Optimization Re-enablement

```javascript
// next.config.mjs optimizations to re-enable:
- Image optimization: true
- Bundle optimization: true
- Minification: true
- Tree shaking: true
- Code splitting: optimized
- Static export optimization: enabled for applicable pages
```

### Deployment Health Checks

- **Application Startup**: Verify application starts successfully
- **API Endpoint Verification**: Test critical API endpoints (/api/health, /api/methodologies, etc.)
- **Database Connectivity**: Verify database connection and basic queries
- **External API Integration**: Test external API connectivity and authentication
- **Performance Baseline**: Verify performance metrics meet baseline requirements

### Integration with Existing Architecture

- **Vercel Platform**: Continue using Vercel as deployment platform
- **Next.js Build System**: Enhance existing build process with optimizations
- **Environment Variables**: Integrate with Story 1.4 environment management
- **Database Migrations**: Integrate with Story 1.5 migration automation
- **Monitoring**: Prepare for Story 1.7 security and monitoring integration
