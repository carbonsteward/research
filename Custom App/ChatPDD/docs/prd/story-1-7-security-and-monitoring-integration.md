# Story 1.7: Security and Monitoring Integration

## Story

As a **development team**,
I want **automated security scanning and comprehensive monitoring**,
so that **the application maintains high security standards and operational visibility**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Dependency vulnerability scanning is integrated into CI pipeline
- AC2: Code quality and security scanning identifies potential security issues
- AC3: Health monitoring provides real-time visibility into application status across environments
- AC4: Deployment notifications and status reporting keep team informed of pipeline status
- AC5: Performance monitoring tracks build times, deployment duration, and application metrics

## Integration Verification

- IV1: Security scanning integrates with existing code patterns without false positives
- IV2: Monitoring systems work correctly with existing health check endpoint (/api/health)
- IV3: Performance monitoring establishes baseline metrics that reflect current application performance
- IV4: Security scanning doesn't block development workflow unnecessarily
- IV5: Monitoring alerts are actionable and don't create alert fatigue

## Rollback Procedures for Story 1.7

### Security and Monitoring Rollback

1. **Security Scanning Rollback**:
   - Disable automated vulnerability scanning
   - Restore manual security review procedures
   - Remove security-related CI pipeline steps
   - Implement manual dependency auditing

2. **Monitoring System Rollback**:
   - Disable automated monitoring and alerting
   - Remove monitoring integrations from application
   - Restore manual health check procedures
   - Document monitoring system issues

3. **Performance Monitoring Rollback**:
   - Remove performance monitoring instrumentation
   - Restore baseline performance measurement procedures
   - Disable automated performance alerts
   - Maintain manual performance testing procedures

### Security Continuity Procedures

- Manual security auditing procedures
- Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- Manual code review for security issues
- Emergency security response procedures without automated systems

## Technical Context

**Current State**: No automated security scanning or comprehensive monitoring
**Target State**: Integrated security scanning and monitoring across entire CI/CD pipeline
**Risk Level**: Low - Monitoring and security enhancements are non-destructive additions
**Dependencies**: All previous stories (1.1-1.6) - Security and monitoring layer across complete CI/CD infrastructure
**Blocks**: None (Final story in epic)

## Implementation Notes

### Security Scanning Integration

```yaml
# Security Pipeline Components:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit, Snyk, etc.)
- Code quality analysis (SonarQube, CodeQL)
- Secret scanning for accidentally committed credentials
- License compliance checking
- Security-focused ESLint rules
- Dockerfile and container security scanning (if applicable)
```

### Monitoring and Alerting Architecture

```yaml
# Monitoring Integration Points:
- CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring:
  - Build time tracking and alerts
  - Test execution duration and failure rates
  - Deployment success/failure tracking
  - Pipeline performance optimization

- Application Monitoring:
  - Health check endpoint enhancement (/api/health)
  - Error rate monitoring and alerting
  - Performance metric tracking
  - Database connection and query performance

- Infrastructure Monitoring:
  - Vercel deployment status and performance
  - Database connection and query monitoring
  - External API integration health and performance
  - Environment-specific monitoring configuration
```

### Enhanced Health Check Implementation

Current health check endpoint (`/api/health`) enhancement:
```javascript
// Enhanced health check should include:
- Database connectivity verification
- External API integration status
- Application performance metrics
- Environment-specific health indicators
- Detailed error reporting for monitoring systems
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **Winston Logging**: Enhance existing logging system with monitoring integration
- **External APIs**: Monitor health and performance of Climate Policy Radar, FAO FAOLEX, NGFS, Climate Impact Explorer integrations
- **Database Monitoring**: Integrate with Prisma ORM for query performance monitoring
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Monitor Jest and Playwright test execution performance

### Security Considerations for Existing Architecture

- **API Endpoint Security**: Security scanning for all existing API routes
- **Database Security**: Connection security and query injection prevention
- **Environment Variable Security**: Secure secrets management validation
- **External API Security**: Secure API key management and rotation procedures

### Performance Baseline Establishment

- **Current Performance Metrics**: Establish baseline for existing application performance
- **Build Performance**: Track and optimize CI/CD pipeline performance
- **Deployment Performance**: Monitor deployment duration and success rates
- **Application Performance**: Monitor response times, error rates, and resource utilization

### Notification and Reporting Integration

- **GitHub Integration**: Status checks and PR comments for security and performance issues
- **Team Notifications**: Integration with team communication channels for critical alerts
- **Dashboard Integration**: Prepare monitoring data for potential future dashboard implementation
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and reporting for security and compliance requirements
