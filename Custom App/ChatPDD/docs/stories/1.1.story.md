# Story 1.1: Repository Foundation and Git Workflow Setup

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **development team**
- I want **proper git repository initialization and workflow establishment**
- so that **we have a solid foundation for implementing CI/CD automation**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: All current project files are properly committed to git with meaningful initial commit message
- AC2: Git repository has proper .gitignore configuration that excludes node_modules, .env files, and build artifacts
- AC3: Main and develop branch structure is established with protection rules
- AC4: Current Vercel deployment configuration issues are identified and documented for resolution
- AC5: Git repository setup includes proper branch protection rules and merge policies
- AC6: Initial commit strategy preserves all existing functionality and configurations

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Pre-commit Analysis and File Cataloging (AC: 1, 6)
  - [ ] Analyze all untracked files in the repository using `git status --porcelain`
  - [ ] Categorize files into critical vs. generated/temporary files
  - [ ] Document any large files or sensitive data that shouldn't be committed
  - [ ] Verify all required configuration files are present (.env.example, package.json, etc.)

- [ ] Task 2: Create Comprehensive .gitignore Configuration (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create .gitignore file with Node.js and Next.js specific exclusions
  - [ ] Add pnpm-specific exclusions (pnpm-lock.yaml should be committed)
  - [ ] Exclude build artifacts: .next/, out/, dist/, coverage/
  - [ ] Exclude environment files: .env, .env.local, .env.production
  - [ ] Exclude IDE and OS specific files: .DS_Store, .vscode/, .idea/
  - [ ] Exclude database files: *.db, *.sqlite
  - [ ] Exclude log files: *.log, logs/

- [ ] Task 3: Execute Initial Git Repository Setup (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Initialize git repository if not already done: `git init`
  - [ ] Configure git user settings for the repository
  - [ ] Stage all appropriate files for initial commit using `git add .`
  - [ ] Create meaningful initial commit with conventional commit format
  - [ ] Verify no sensitive data or large files are included in commit

- [ ] Task 4: Establish Branch Structure and Protection (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Create and push main branch as default production branch
  - [ ] Create develop branch from main for integration work
  - [ ] Configure branch protection rules for main branch:
    - Require pull request reviews before merging
    - Require status checks to pass before merging
    - Require branches to be up to date before merging
    - Include administrators in restrictions
  - [ ] Set develop as default branch for new pull requests

- [ ] Task 5: Identify and Document Deployment Issues (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Analyze current Vercel deployment configuration
  - [ ] Document specific deployment failures and error messages
  - [ ] Review vercel.json configuration if it exists
  - [ ] Identify missing environment variables for deployment
  - [ ] Create deployment troubleshooting documentation

- [ ] Task 6: Verification and Testing (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Test that `pnpm dev` continues to work after git setup
  - [ ] Test that `pnpm build` continues to work after git setup
  - [ ] Verify all development scripts function correctly
  - [ ] Confirm no files or configurations were lost during setup
  - [ ] Test git workflow with a sample branch and merge

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the foundational story - no previous story context available.

### Current State Analysis
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#technical-debt-and-known-issues]

**Critical Current Issues:**
- **Git Status**: All files are currently untracked (major blocker for CI/CD)
- **Repository State**: No initial commit has been made
- **Deployment Issues**: Vercel deployment configuration problems mentioned
- **Missing CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions workflows exist

### Project Structure Context
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#source-tree-and-module-organization]

**Current Directory Structure:**
```
ChatPDD/
├── app/                     # Next.js App Router (main application)
├── components/              # React components (shadcn/ui + custom)
├── hooks/                   # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                     # Utilities and database connection
├── services/                # Business logic and validation
├── utils/                   # Shared utilities and logging
├── prisma/                  # Database schema and migrations
├── __tests__/               # Testing infrastructure
├── scripts/                 # Build and utility scripts
└── public/                  # Static assets
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#actual-tech-stack]

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10.8.1 (must preserve pnpm-lock.yaml)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright configured
- **TypeScript**: Version 5+ with strict configuration

### Git Configuration Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/story-1-1-repository-foundation-and-git-workflow-setup.md#git-repository-setup-specifics]

**Branch Protection Rules:**
```bash
# Required protection settings:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions
- Allow force pushes: false
- Allow deletions: false
```

**Commit Message Standards:**
- Use conventional commit format for automated changelog generation
- Format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(git): establish repository foundation`)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#critical-files-for-understanding-the-system]

**Key Configuration Files to Preserve:**
- `package.json` - Package management and scripts
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `jest.config.js` - Testing configuration
- `playwright.config.js` - E2E testing configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Testing Requirements
**Test Strategy:** No specific testing requirements for this foundational story beyond verification that existing functionality continues to work.

**Manual Test Steps:**
- Run `pnpm dev` and verify development server starts successfully
- Run `pnpm build` and verify production build completes without errors
- Run `pnpm db:push` and verify database connection works
- Create test branch, make sample commit, and verify git workflow functions

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#build-and-configuration-issues]

**Current Build Configuration Issues (DO NOT FIX IN THIS STORY):**
- Build optimizations disabled (`ignoreBuildErrors: true`)
- ESLint disabled during builds (`ignoreDuringBuilds: true`)
- Image optimization disabled (`unoptimized: true`)

**Note:** These issues will be addressed in subsequent CI/CD implementation stories.

### Rollback Procedures
[Source: docs/prd/story-1-1-repository-foundation-and-git-workflow-setup.md#rollback-procedures]

**If Git Setup Fails:**
1. Create complete backup of project directory before starting
2. Use `git reflog` and `git fsck` to recover any lost commits
3. Restore from backup if necessary
4. Verify all development commands work after restoration

### Environment Variables
[Source: docs/brownfield-architecture.md#deployment-reality]

**Required Environment Variables (for reference):**
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `CLIMATE_POLICY_RADAR_API_KEY`: External API access
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment specification
