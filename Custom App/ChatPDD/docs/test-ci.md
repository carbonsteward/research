# CI Pipeline Test

This file is created to test the newly implemented CI pipeline.

## Test Scenarios

1. **Code Quality**: Ensure TypeScript compilation passes
2. **Security**: Verify no vulnerable dependencies
3. **Build**: Confirm Next.js build succeeds
4. **Lint**: Validate ESLint rules compliance

## Expected Results

- ✅ All CI jobs should pass
- ✅ Pipeline should complete within 10 minutes
- ✅ Caching should improve subsequent runs
- ✅ Security audit should pass with no critical vulnerabilities

## Pipeline Components Tested

- [x] Lint & Type Check Job
- [x] Security Scan Job
- [x] Code Quality Check Job
- [x] Status Check Job

This test validates Story 1.2 implementation.
