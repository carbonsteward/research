# TWIGA Taxonomy Loader Specification

---

## Purpose

Automate ingestion, parsing, and version control of the TWIGA Questionnaire data structure into the database system. This enables:

- Admin control of questions, modules, scoring weights
- API-ready delivery of question sets to frontends
- Smooth future updates without full code releases

---

- Display Name (e.g. "Governance", "Strategy", "Management Profile", etc.)
- Module Type: Foundation / Zebra / Impact

### Submodule (Optional)
- Subsections within modules (for grouping questions)
- Used in Financial, Crisis, Supply Chain, Impact modules

### Question

- Zebra Score Weight (integer)
- Additional Scoring Rules (e.g. Zebra score conditional logic)

### Answer Option
- Option ID
- Option Label (multi-language)
- Scoring logic (if selection triggers Zebra point)

### SDG Mapping
- SDG Goal (1-17)
- Sub-Target reference
- Impact Category: Economic, Social, Biosphere

## Loader Operation

1. Upload full XLSX master file.
2. Parse sheets into normalized DB tables.
3. Validate for:
    - Duplicate IDs
    - Missing scoring weights
    - Broken dependencies
4. Version control snapshot applied.
5. API endpoint to retrieve latest active version.

---

## Database Schema Preview

---

## Loader Output

- Fully normalized DB ingestion
- API-ready JSON structure
- Scoring Engine synchronization

---

## Deployment Note

- This loader becomes core part of TWIGA Admin Panel.
- Only Admin role has upload authority.
- Validation routines prevent corrupt taxonomy updates.


# Loader Build Phase 2 — JSON Schema, Admin API & Scoring Engine Logic

---

## JSON Schema Output Example

Upon successful ingestion, the loader will produce JSON outputs like the following for API delivery to frontend apps.

### Modules JSON Example

```json
{
  "moduleId": "GOV",
  "displayName": "Governance",
  "moduleType": "Foundation"
}

Questions JSON Example

{
  "questionId": "GOV-01",
  "moduleId": "GOV",
  "submodule": null,
  "questionTextEN": "Does your organization have an active Board of Directors?",
  "questionTextES": "¿Su organización tiene un Consejo de Administración activo?",
  "answerType": "Single Select",
  "disclosurePoints": 5,
  "zebraPoints": 2,
  "dependencyRule": null,
  "options": [
    {
      "optionId": "GOV-01-A1",
      "optionLabelEN": "Yes",
      "zebraScoringRule": 2
    },
    {
      "optionId": "GOV-01-A2",
      "optionLabelEN": "No",
      "zebraScoringRule": 0
    }
  ]
}

Admin Upload API Specification

Upload Taxonomy File

Endpoint:
POST /api/admin/taxonomy/upload

Auth: Admin-only

Payload:
	•	Multipart Form Data
	•	File field: XLSX file upload

Validation Logic:
	•	Ensure:
	•	All question IDs are unique.
	•	Modules referenced in questions exist.
	•	Scoring weights are present.
	•	Dependencies refer to valid question IDs.
	•	On success:
	•	Apply version increment.
	•	Store all parsed data into DB.
	•	Mark version as active.

Response:

{
  "uploadStatus": "success",
  "versionId": "v2024.07.01",
  "totalQuestionsImported": 187
}


⸻

Rollback / Version History API

Endpoint:
GET /api/admin/taxonomy/versions — list previous versions
POST /api/admin/taxonomy/activate/{versionId} — revert to prior version

⸻

Scoring Engine Calculation Logic

Disclosure Score
	•	Formula:

DisclosureScore = (Total Disclosure Points Answered) / (Total Possible Disclosure Points)

	•	Expressed as percentage for platform display.

Zebra Scores
	•	Per Impact Category (Economic / Social / Biosphere / Sectoral SDG)
	•	Formula:

ZebraScore = WeightedSum of ZebraPoints per Question / Total Max Zebra Points in module

	•	SDG sub-scores generated based on questions mapped to SDGs.
	•	Each sector module may have:
	•	Zebra Score
	•	Percentile calculation relative to peer submissions

Dependencies
	•	Questions only active if prior dependent answer is selected.
	•	Evaluated dynamically both in frontend & scoring logic.

⸻

Deployment Note
	•	Loader service should include full logging for:
	•	Ingestion success
	•	Validation errors
	•	File version history
	•	All file uploads stored securely with backup retention.


# Loader Build Phase 3 — Full Integration Into TWIGA Stack

---

## Full Loader Service Flow

1️⃣ **Admin Upload:**
- XLSX file uploaded via Admin Panel.

2️⃣ **Validation Layer:**
- Validate modules, questions, dependencies, scoring weights.

3️⃣ **Parsing Layer:**
- Extract normalized data into modules, questions, options, scoring, dependencies.

4️⃣ **Database Insertion:**
- Populate versioned taxonomy tables (`taxonomy_modules`, `taxonomy_questions`, `taxonomy_options`, `taxonomy_versions`).

5️⃣ **Scoring Engine Sync:**
- Update scoring calculation engine with new scoring weights and logic.

6️⃣ **API Refresh:**
- Frontend calls always pull the latest active taxonomy version.

---

## Integrated Admin Panel Features

- Upload XLSX interface with drag & drop.
- Live validation feedback before ingestion.
- View current active version.
- View previous versions (version history table).
- Activate older versions if rollback needed.
- Audit logs of who uploaded which version.
- Export current taxonomy as XLSX for backup/editing.

---

## Unified API Behavior After Integration

- `/api/taxonomy/current` — returns current active questionnaire structure.
- `/api/taxonomy/module/{moduleId}` — fetch specific module question set.
- `/api/taxonomy/version/{versionId}` — load specific past version.

---

## Scoring Engine Integration

- Loader directly feeds updated scoring rules into calculation engine.
- All company assessments dynamically scored using latest active version.
- Historical assessment scores locked to version used at time of submission.

---

## Security & Stability

- Only Admin role can upload or activate taxonomy versions.
- All uploads stored in versioned secure file storage.
- Validation layer prevents schema corruption.
- Transaction-safe DB insertion prevents partial updates.
- Full activity logs for auditability.

---

## Deployment Sequence

- Phase 1: Deploy Loader microservice.
- Phase 2: Integrate with Admin Panel UI.
- Phase 3: Connect Loader output to Scoring Engine.
- Phase 4: Enable unified API access for Web & Swipe Apps.

---

## Final Outcome

- Fully dynamic questionnaire engine.
- Zero developer intervention for future taxonomy updates.
- Fully API-driven for scalable frontend consumption.
- Secure, auditable, and version-controlled architecture.
