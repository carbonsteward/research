# TWIGA Execution Playbook — Phase 3

---

## 1️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline Specification

### CI Pipeline

- Code pushed to main repository triggers:
  - Code linting
  - Unit tests (backend, loader, frontend)
  - Build artifact generation (Docker containers)
  - Static security scanning (Snyk, Trivy)
  - Version tagging

### CD Pipeline

- Successful builds trigger:
  - Deployment to staging environment
  - Automated integration tests on staging
  - Deployment approval gates for production
  - Rolling deployments to production containers
  - Post-deployment monitoring verification

### Tools

- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / CircleCI
- Docker Hub or AWS ECR for container registry
- AWS ECS / EKS for container orchestration

```
[ Admin Users ] --> [ Admin Panel UI ] --> [ Taxonomy Loader Microservice ] --> [ Taxonomy Database Tables ]
[ Companies / Investors ] --> [ Web & Swipe Frontends ] --> [ Core API Layer ] --> [ Main Database (Postgres) ]
[ Core API Layer ] --> [ Scoring Engine ] --> [ Versioned Scoring Tables ]
[ Core API Layer ] --> [ Matchmaking Service ] --> [ Chat Service (WebSocket) ]
[ Core API Layer ] --> [ Payments Service (Stripe) ]
[ Core API Layer ] --> [ Data Room (S3 Storage) ]
[ All Services ] --> [ AWS Cloud Infrastructure ] --> [ WAF, IDS, Monitoring ]
```

## 3️⃣ Security Hardening Plan

### Application Security

- Input validation at API layer
- JWT authentication + role-based access control
- Secure password storage (bcrypt hashing)
- Rate limiting on critical endpoints
- CSRF protection on admin interfaces

### Network Security

- VPC private subnet isolation
- TLS 1.2+ enforced everywhere
- Strict IAM policies between services
- Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)
- Intrusion Detection System (AWS GuardDuty)

### Data Security

- Full encryption in transit and at rest
- S3 bucket encryption (AES-256)
- RDS encryption (KMS-managed keys)
- Secure handling of uploaded files in Data Rooms

### Compliance

- GDPR compliance (data retention & right to erasure)
- Payment data handled fully by PCI-compliant Stripe

### Logging & Monitoring

- Centralized logging (CloudWatch, ELK stack)
- Audit logs for admin actions
- Alerting on anomalous behavior

## 5️⃣ Post-Launch Stabilization

- 24/7 monitoring for first 30 days
- Daily error log review
- Weekly stakeholder review sessions
- Gradual scale-up of investor onboarding volume
