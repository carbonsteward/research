# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a research repository focused on climate policy analysis, carbon markets research, legislative automation, and AI governance studies. The repository contains comprehensive analytical reports, stakeholder databases, and multi-agent framework tools for policy research and analysis.

## Core Research Areas

### Climate and Carbon Markets Analysis
- **Dominican Republic Carbon Markets**: Comprehensive stakeholder analysis with 25 verified stakeholders and $67M+ funding tracking
- **Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)**: Government response analysis and sentiment tracking
- **Carbon Market Mechanisms**: Article 6.2/6.4, REDD+, VCM frameworks, ETS development

### Legislative and AI Automation Research
- **US AI Legislative Analysis**: Federal AI spending ($75.1B civilian IT), vendor partnerships, performance metrics
- **Bill Amendment Recommendation Systems**: API analysis for legislative automation platforms
- **Government AI Adoption**: Congressional modernization initiatives and regulatory frameworks

### BMAD Framework (Multi-Agent System)
- **Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents (analyst, architect, developer, PM, QA, UX) with defined roles
- **Team Compositions**: Full-stack, minimal, infrastructure/devops team configurations
- **Expansion Packs**: Game development, infrastructure specializations, and creator tools

## Key File Types and Formats

### Research Data
- **JSON databases**: Structured stakeholder data with metadata, verification status, funding information
- **CSV files**: Tabular data for spreadsheet analysis and visualization
- **Markdown reports**: Executive summaries, technical analyses, and comprehensive findings

### Interactive Presentations
- **HTML files**: GitHub Pages-compatible interactive reports with stakeholder mapping
- **Print versions**: PDF-optimized layouts for formal documentation

### BMAD Agent Bundles
- **Agent definitions**: Text files defining specialized AI agent roles and capabilities
- **Team configurations**: Pre-defined multi-agent team compositions for different project types
- **Web bundles**: Self-contained agent packages with resource navigation systems

## Data Analysis Workflows

### Carbon Markets Research
```bash
# For data analysis
# Use CSV files for spreadsheet analysis
# Use JSON databases for programmatic access
# Reference verified sources in metadata sections
```

### Legislative Research
```bash
# Track 685+ AI-related bills across federal/state levels
# Monitor federal contractions and vendor partnerships
# Analyze budget allocations and ROI measurements
```

### Multi-Agent Research Operations
```bash
# BMAD agents operate with YAML dependency structures
# Resource navigation uses folder#filename format
# Agent configurations include startup instructions and personas
```

## Research Environment

### Python Environment
- **Virtual environment**: `gpt_researcher_env/` with Python 3.13
- **Research tools**: GPT-researcher and related AI analysis frameworks
- **Package management**: Standard pip-based dependency management

### Data Verification Standards
- All stakeholder information verified through official government publications
- International agreements and UNFCCC documents as primary sources
- Multi-language source validation (Spanish for DR research)
- Quarterly update cycles for dynamic policy landscapes

## File Organization Principles

### Hierarchical Structure
- Country/region-specific folders for geographical research
- ARCHIVE/ subdirectories for historical versions and deprecated analyses
- Themed reporting with executive summaries and detailed technical analyses

### Naming Conventions
- **Database files**: `[COUNTRY/TOPIC]_DATABASE.json`
- **Report files**: `[Topic]_[Type]_Report.md`
- **Stakeholder data**: `[TOPIC]_STAKEHOLDERS.csv`
- **Interactive presentations**: `index.html` for main presentations

### Version Control
- Version numbers in metadata sections of JSON databases
- Last updated timestamps for all research databases
- Archive old versions rather than overwriting historical data

## Research Quality Standards

### Verification Requirements
- Multiple source confirmation for all stakeholder information
- Official publication verification for funding amounts and partnerships
- Cross-reference international agreements and regulatory frameworks
- Maintain audit trails in metadata sections

### Update Protocols
- Quarterly reviews for rapidly changing policy landscapes
- Event-driven updates for major regulatory changes
- Stakeholder engagement tracking for active carbon market developments
- International agreement monitoring for Article 6 mechanisms

## Integration with External Systems

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- Interactive HTML reports designed for GitHub Pages hosting
- Print-optimized versions for PDF conversion
- Mobile-responsive layouts for stakeholder mapping visualizations

### BMAD Agent Deployment
- Web-compatible agent bundles for multi-agent research orchestration
- Resource navigation systems for complex research dependencies
- Scalable team configurations for different research project types
