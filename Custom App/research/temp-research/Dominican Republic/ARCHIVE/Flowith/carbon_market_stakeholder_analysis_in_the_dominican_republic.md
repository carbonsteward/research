# Carbon Market Stakeholders in the Dominican Republic: A Comprehensive Analysis

***

### **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the key stakeholders shaping the burgeoning carbon market in the Dominican Republic. The analysis reveals a dynamic ecosystem characterized by strong government leadership, proactive private sector engagement, and critical support from international partners.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Pivotal Government Leadership:** The **Consejo Nacional para el Cambio Climático y Mecanismo de Desarrollo Limpio (CNCCMDL)** stands as the central architect and authority, driving policy and establishing the market's regulatory framework. Its influence is paramount, complemented by the technical and regulatory roles of the **Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (MMARN)** and the financial oversight of the **Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (SIMV)**.

*   **Proactive Private Sector Pioneers:** The private sector is not merely a participant but a primary engine of market development. Energy giants like **EGE Haina** and **AES Dominicana** are leading the supply side with massive investments in renewable energy and decarbonization projects. On the demand and finance side, institutions like **Banco Popular** and **Banreservas** are creating the financial instruments (e.g., green bonds) and project financing necessary to capitalize on climate action. This engagement extends across diverse industries, with companies like **Ron Barceló** and members of **ADOCEM** demonstrating a growing commitment to carbon neutrality and emissions reduction.

*   **Essential International and Civil Society Support:** The market's foundation is significantly strengthened by international organizations such as the **World Bank** and **PNUD**, which provide crucial funding, technical assistance, and policy guidance.

### **Introduction**

Carbon markets are a key mechanism for mobilizing finance to address climate change. They operate on the principle of placing a price on carbon emissions, creating economic incentives for entities to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) output. By allowing the trading of carbon credits—each representing one tonne of CO2 equivalent reduced or removed from the atmosphere—these markets channel investment into mitigation projects such as renewable energy, reforestation, and industrial efficiency.

The Dominican Republic, a Small Island Developing State highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, has integrated climate action into its national development strategy. The country's commitment to its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement necessitates significant investment in a low-carbon transition.

The objective of this report is to provide a detailed analysis of the key stakeholders involved in the Dominican Republic's carbon market. By mapping the roles, objectives, and influence of government agencies, private sector entities, international partners, and civil society, this document aims to illuminate the intricate relationships that will define the future of climate finance and action in the nation.

### **Conclusion**

The Dominican Republic's carbon market is emerging from a phase of strategic planning into one of active implementation, propelled by a remarkably aligned and collaborative group of stakeholders. This analysis demonstrates a clear division of labor and a powerful synergy between public and private actors.

The government, with the **CNCCMDL** at its core, has successfully established the political will and regulatory architecture necessary for a national market. This framework has, in turn, unleashed the private sector's potential. Energy leaders like **EGE Haina** and **AES Dominicana** are not waiting for mandates but are proactively developing the large-scale renewable projects that will form the backbone of the credit supply. Concurrently, financial innovators like **Banreservas** and **Banco Popular** are creating the capital pathways to fund this green transition, while a growing number of corporations across all industries are signaling demand by committing to carbon neutrality.

This domestic momentum is amplified and de-risked by international partners like the **World Bank** and **PNUD**, who provide the technical assistance and catalytic funding needed to overcome institutional hurdles. The ecosystem is completed by the vital contributions of academia and civil society. **INTEC** is building the local human capital and scientific foundation, while NGOs like **Grupo Jaragua** and **Cedaf** ensure that market activities translate into tangible benefits for biodiversity and local communities, safeguarding the environmental and social integrity of the entire system.

Looking forward, the evolution of the Dominican carbon market will depend on maintaining this collaborative spirit. The immediate priorities must be the operationalization of a transparent and credible MRV system and the strategic positioning of the country within the international framework of the Paris Agreement's Article 6. Success will create a virtuous cycle: high-integrity projects will attract premium international investment, which will further accelerate the nation's transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy. The foundation is strong; the challenge now is to build upon it with rigor and scale.
