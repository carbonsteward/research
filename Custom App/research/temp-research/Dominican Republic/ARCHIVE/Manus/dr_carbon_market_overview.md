# Defining the Carbon Pricing Instrument Road Map in the Dominican Republic | UNFCCC

The Ci-ACA initiative was announced during COP22 in Marrakesh and was initially established for 2 years. However, considering the demand from member countries, it was renewed in 2019 until December 2021. The initiative is purely on a voluntary basis and is jointly managed by the UNFCCC secretariat and its Regional Collaboration Centres. Under this project one of the countries supported by RCC St. George’s is the Dominican Republic. The project was launched in December 2017, when RCC St. George’s, together with The National Council for Climate Change and the Clean Development Mechanism (CNCCMDL) conducted a national consultation on the topic of carbon pricing instruments in Santo Domingo. The tools evaluated in the framework of the Ci-ACA 2.0 Dominican Republic project include the potential implementation of:

*   **Carbon Tax** to incentivize reducing emissions through a price signal;
*   **Emission Trading Scheme** with the establishment of a limit on direct GHG emissions to the identified sectors; and
*   The implementation of a market for **Clean Energy Certificates**, linked to the objectives of renewable energy in the Dominican Republic and their respective involvement in reducing emissions.

Those are aligning and will support the achievement of the objectives defined in the National Development Strategy and in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

On 12 August 2020, the Strategic Steering Committee for Ci-ACA 2020 presented the preliminary results from the work done interviewing key stakeholders on many aspects to define the Carbon Pricing Instrument Road Map in the Dominican Republic; 22 persons participated in the Steering Committee meeting. Introducing the session, Mr. Federico Grullón, head of Mitigation Department, from the CNCCMDL, explained the meeting objectives, expressed his gratitude for the participation of representatives of different organizations and mentioned the importance that economic instruments have for the Climate Change Mitigation Strategy MexiCO2 (the company leading the technical work in close collaboration with national consultants). He also provided an overview of the project activities and achievements, which included some preliminary results which indicate there are several positive conditions for the implementation of a carbon pricing implementation instrument in the Dominican Republic.

The project team conducted more than 32 interviews with key stakeholders on policy implementation against climate change. Most of the stakeholders consulted expressed their preference for the use of revenues of carbon pricing application (carbon tax or selling carbon emission permits) in mitigation and adaptation actions and poverty alleviation. They wanted to have more clarity on conditions of a carbon market\'s operations and transactions, specifically under Dominican Republic national conditions. There were some concerns raised on legislation, specifically about the use of existing legal and regulatory framework on securities versus making a new framework and governance model that included private and public entities. Also, the stakeholders highlighted synergies with the national MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) System, especially in collecting data and establishing information protection standards, as well as interoperability with other national systems and the need for impact studies to ensure driving the results. Further key areas were highlighted for the roadmap to introduce a carbon pricing scheme, these include:

*   Maintain a dialogue with stakeholders;
*   Development of impact studies on fiscal and macroeconomic indicators;
*   Assess tax burden by sectors in an economic reactivation scenario;
*   Capacity-building and institutional strengthening;
*   Comprehensive communication and awareness strategy; and
*   Share governance space to ensure the equal weighting to public-private participation.

Conscious that the current economic landscape is complex and different scenarios at the macro level are foreseen, governments and private sectors are now discussing the pathway to choose incentives to build into their economic recovery policies and to adapt to the new trends with creativity and speed. The encounter of the steering committee signalled their intent to continue considering carbon pricing as a policy tool to enrich its climate policy mix and incorporate it into their economic recovery plans and strategy.



## Government and Regulatory Stakeholders

Based on the initial research, the following government and regulatory bodies are key stakeholders in the Dominican Republic's carbon market:

## Analysis of Stakeholder Relevance and Relationships

The carbon market in the Dominican Republic is a complex ecosystem involving a diverse range of stakeholders, each with distinct roles, interests, and levels of influence. Understanding their relevance and the relationships between them is crucial for effective policy-making, project development, and market functionality.

**Government and Regulatory Bodies (e.g., CNCCMDL, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Energy and Mines, Legislative Bodies, National MRV System):**

*   **Relevance:** These entities form the foundational layer of the carbon market. They are responsible for establishing the legal and regulatory framework, setting national climate targets (NDCs), developing carbon pricing policies (e.g., carbon tax, ETS, clean energy certificates), and ensuring compliance. Their decisions directly shape the market's structure, scope, and operational rules. The CNCCMDL, in particular, acts as a central coordinating body for climate change initiatives.
*   **Relationships:** They interact with all other stakeholder groups. They consult with the private sector to understand their needs and concerns, engage with international organizations for technical and financial support, and collaborate with NGOs on specific projects and awareness campaigns. The relationship is primarily top-down in terms of policy setting, but also involves significant feedback loops through consultations and partnerships. The need for a clear legal framework and governance model that includes both public and private entities highlights the importance of strong, collaborative relationships between government and the private sector.

**Private Sector and Business Stakeholders (e.g., Industrial and Enterprise Representatives, Energy Sector Companies, Financial Institutions, Consulting Firms, Project Developers):**

*   **Relevance:** The private sector is the engine of the carbon market. They are the primary emitters of greenhouse gases and, therefore, the target of carbon pricing mechanisms. Simultaneously, they are also the innovators and implementers of emission reduction projects, and potential buyers and sellers of carbon credits. Their investment in cleaner technologies, participation in trading schemes, and development of carbon offset projects are essential for achieving national climate goals. Financial institutions provide the necessary capital and market infrastructure.
*   **Relationships:** Their relationship with government bodies is one of compliance and collaboration. They are subject to regulations but also seek to influence policy to ensure a favorable business environment. They engage with consulting firms for technical expertise and project development. Their interaction with international organizations often involves seeking financing, technical assistance, and market access. The emphasis on public-private participation in governance spaces underscores the need for a strong, cooperative relationship between these two sectors.

They also collaborate with the private sector by providing financing for climate-friendly projects and facilitating market access. Their role is often one of partnership and support, aiming to strengthen the Dominican Republic's capacity to engage effectively in the global carbon market. The involvement of multiple international financial institutions (CIF, IDB, World Bank) indicates a coordinated effort to support the country's energy transition and climate goals.

**Interdependencies and Dynamics:**

The success of the carbon market in the Dominican Republic hinges on the effective interplay between these stakeholder groups. Government bodies need the private sector to implement emission reductions and drive innovation, and they rely on international organizations for financial and technical support. The private sector needs a clear and stable regulatory environment from the government, and access to financing and expertise from international partners. International organizations and NGOs, in turn, need strong national commitment and private sector engagement to achieve their climate objectives.

Challenges and opportunities arise from these relationships. Concerns about legislation and the need for impact studies highlight the importance of transparent and inclusive dialogue between government and the private sector. The focus on capacity-building and communication strategies indicates a recognition of the need to empower all stakeholders with the knowledge and tools to participate effectively. The development of mechanisms like the Blue Carbon Exchange demonstrates how local NGOs can drive innovative projects with broader environmental and economic benefits, often with support from international partners.

In summary, the Dominican Republic's carbon market is evolving through a collaborative effort involving national government, local businesses, and global climate finance and expertise. The ongoing dialogue and partnerships among these stakeholders will be critical in shaping a robust and effective carbon pricing framework that contributes to the country's sustainable development and climate goals.
