## Government Response to SBTi: Adoption vs. Non-Adoption

Governments generally recognize the value of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for corporate climate action, but direct adoption or mandating of SBTi for governmental entities is not widespread.

*   **SBTi's Focus:** The SBTi primarily focuses on mobilizing the private sector to set science-based emissions reduction targets. It does not currently set targets for governments or public institutions.
*   **Government Acknowledgment:** Many governments acknowledge the importance of SBTi, seeing a correlation between companies adopting SBTi and a country's overall climate progress. Setting SBTi-aligned targets can also help companies comply with evolving government regulations.
*   **Limited Direct Mandates:** As of April 2022, no major economy had mandated businesses to set verified, science-based emissions reduction goals.
*   **Instances of Non-Adoption:** The UK government, for example, explicitly stated in November 2023 that it would not commit to adopting SBTi for its Ministry of Defence or its major suppliers.
*   **SBTi's Advocacy:** The SBTi advocates for policies that support the 1.5Â°C global warming limit and emphasizes an "ambition loop" where private sector and government actions are mutually supportive for decarbonization.

In conclusion, while governments generally support the SBTi's role in the private sector, they are not widely adopting or mandating it for their own operations, and there are instances of explicit non-commitment.
